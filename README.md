## Client
- **Agency:** Alda Strategic (Noa Hecht, CCO)
- **Developer:** Mattamy Homes
- **Project:** Vermillion master-planned community
- **Location:** Sanford, North Carolina

## Brand Brief

Vermillion is a master-planned neighborhood rooted in Sanford's brick-making heritage. The site sits on a geological intersection of ancient coastal sand and Piedmont clay — the raw materials that made the region the "Brick Capital of the USA."

### Core Themes
- **Nature** — pastoral countryside, preserved streams, rolling landscape
- **Connection** — linear parks, winding trails threading neighbors together
- **Community** — communal spaces, rustic-luxe gathering areas
- **Heritage** — brick-making craft, kiln history, artisanal permanence
- **Piedmont Clay** — geological strata, earthen textures, deep roots
- **The Color Vermillion** — rust, corten steel, fired clay, warmth
